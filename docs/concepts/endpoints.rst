Model Endpoints
===============

Unify lets you query model endpoints across providers. In this section, we explain what an endpoint is and how it relates to the concepts of models and providers.

What is a Model Endpoint?
-------------------------

A model endpoint is a model that you can interact with through an API, usually hosted by a provider. Model endpoints, particularly LLM endpoints, play a critical role when building and deploying AI applications at scale.  

A model can be offered by different providers through one or multiple endpoints. There's loads of ways to categorize providers, and the boundaries can sometimes be blurry as services overlap; but you can think of a provider as an end-to-end deployment stack that comes with unique sets of features, performance, pricing, and so on. While positive, this diversity also makes it difficult to find the most suitable endpoint for a specific use case. 

.. note::
  Check out our blog post on `cloud serving <https://unify.ai/blog/cloud-model-serving>`_ if you'd like to learn more about providers.

Unify exposes a common HTTP endpoint for all providers, allowing you to query any of them using a **consistent request format, and the same API key**. This lets you use the same model across multiple endpoints, and optimize the performance metrics you care about.

Available Endpoints
-------------------

We strive to integrate the latest LLMs into our platform, across as many providers exposing endpoints for said models.

You can explore our list of supported models through the `benchmarks interface <https://unify.ai/hub>`_ where you can simply search for a model you are interested in to visualise benchmarks and all sorts of relevant information on available endpoints for the model.

  If you prefer programmatic access, you can also use the
  `List Models Endpoint <https://unify.ai/docs/hub/reference/endpoints.html#get-models>`_ in our API to obtain a list of models.


Round Up

You are now familiar with the concept of endpoint and the various types of endpoints we expose. In the next section, we'll dive into the **Benchmarks** and how they can help you find the best endpoint for your needs!
